# Repo Purpose
This is a repo for any one file or small experiments/tests in JavaScript. No actual large projects will be in here, they will have their own repo.
### module_exports
Contains experiments and test files from when I was figuring out the difference between the `exports` and `module.exports` properties in Node.js.
### sequelize-sandbox
Contains basic database, models, and some rudimentary functions for when I was learning to use the Sequelize package.
### Other files
At the current moment, all other files are based on projects or exercises from Eloquent JS.
